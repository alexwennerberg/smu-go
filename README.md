# simple markup (smu) in Go

A rewrite of https://github.com/Gottox/smu in Go -- a markdown-like or
markdown-lite language.

## Why?
Markdown is an extraordinarily complex standard that is often far more
heavy-weight than some situations may require. Working with and extending
"standards-compliant" markdown can be a headache. I also didn't love the
developer experience of working with or using popular Go markdown libraries.
